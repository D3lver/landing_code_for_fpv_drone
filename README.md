TheCode.py - the code for landing.

drone_api.py - classes and functions for the iris fpv drone, i got it from https://github.com/boris-gu/drone-api

calibration.py - the file with some functions, that can help you calibrating your camera. Moreover, one of the functions is actually used in the TheCode.py file to upload coeffs (from my .yaml file).  I guess you will have to edit the TheCode.py a bit, if you are using another coeffs file.

calib.yaml - my coeffs for calibration the camera in aruco.

ArUco marker info: 6x6_250 0.5 meters
